# Netdata Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project sets up a basic monitoring dashboard using Netdata, allowing you to monitor the health and performance of a system in real-time. This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of monitoring, from installation to setting up custom metrics and alerts. 

## Objectives
- Install and configure Netdata on a Linux system.
- Monitor basic system metrics (CPU, memory usage, disk I/O).
- Access and customize the Netdata dashboard.
- Set up an alert for a specific metric (e.g., CPU usage above 80%).
- Automate the setup with shell scripts.

## Project Requirements
- Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting.
- Web browser to access the Netdata dashboard.

## Steps
1. Install Netdata manually.
2. Configure Netdata to monitor key metrics.
3. Customize one aspect of the dashboard.
4. Set up an alert for a specific metric.
5. Automate the setup and testing with shell scripts.

## Shell Scripts
- `setup.sh`: Installs Netdata on a new system.
- `test_dashboard.sh`: Generates system load to test the dashboard.
- `cleanup.sh`: Removes the Netdata agent from the system.

This project aims to help you get hands-on with monitoring tools, automation, and DevOps practices.
